//what the fuck needs to happen in the turn function
/*
Player:
	Ask the user to move each hero;
	if it can fight ask the user.
		if yes	then attack else leave it
		notify the unit. eg it is attacking
	End turn.

computer:
	randomly move the enemies. (maybe we could calculate the closet hero)
	if it can attack then randomly decide 50/50 if it will attack a hero;
		notify the unit... eg it is attacking
	end.
