In this task you will need to use the Observer, Adapter, Facade and Mediator design patterns to create and
simulate movement among units. You will need the classes to be able to satisfy the Observer, Adapter, Facade
and Mediator design patterns.
By making use of the Observer and Mediator patterns, you will be able to simulate game play amongst yourself
and the computer. The Observer should simply observe the game play and alert each the player when it is
their turn and allow the computer to be informed when it is it’s turn. 

The Mediator pattern is implemented by
using the observer pattern in such a way that the classes should not communicate directly with one another but
rather communicate through the mediator and observer respectively. 

The Adapter and Facade pattern should
be implemented in such as way to allow for adaptation between the classes and the Observer and Mediator
patterns. The Facade is used to give the impression that the classes offer a simple method of taking damage,
thereby hiding the Rock, Paper, Scissors complexity (i.e. you will have one function to allow for damage to
be taken by all units).
You will need to allow for the map to be updated after each turn as the units move through the map.
• The Observer and Mediator patterns will be used to organise the game play into a turn based playing
system.
• The Adapter and Facade patterns will be used as a layer of abstraction to allow for a simplified interface
to be used by the Observer and mediator classes.
